  <hr />
  <h2><u>Goals:</u></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      DHG plans on becoming the most skillful and popular clan by the next 5 years, overtaking FaZe Clan and Team SoloMid.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      DHG wants to establish dominance by displaying vigorous, competitive skill against competing players that defy it.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      DHG strives to banish all campers holding hands in Rebirth Island that use rocket launchers and play in a style similar to rats.
    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      Finally, selective members of DHG aspire to become the greatest NCC players of all time.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2><u>Accomplishments:</u></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      DHG members Zaid, Hashem, and Rasheed became some of the most dangerous players in Warzone. In fact, many players, which range from different servers, fear their appearances in their lobbies.

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      DHG member HaShinobi owns the world record for the longest NCC run. However, he doesn't have a gameplay to validate his record. Nevertheless, all DHG members will live the rest of their lives knowing that two of their members broke the world
      record of NCC

    </li>
    <br />
    <li>
      DHG is the first clan ever to create its own currency (Bobby Bucks). The logo designers are Rashidus and DHG Shawerma, and the face on the bill is Bobby (HaShinobi)
    </li>
